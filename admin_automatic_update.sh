# A little script to:
# 	- wait that internet is available
# 	- wait for the automatic software update to be finished running
# 	- apply the apt-get update and upgrade to the system
# This means that updates are installed automatically without
# asking confirmation. This should be ok for most vanilla uses.
#
# SETUP
#
# set the XX_SET_PATH to the log file
#
# To make it run automatically, put it in crontab:
# sudo crontab -e
# and in the root crontab that gets opened:
# @reboot bash PATH_TO_THE_SCRIPT.sh
