# My bash scripts

This folder contains a few bash scripts I use on my machines

To add a bash script to the terminal, just create an alias, for example adding to your .bashrc:

```
alias script_prepare_figures='/home/jrlab/Desktop/Git/MyBashScripts/script_prepare_figures.sh'
```

## script_prepare_figures.sh

A script to (trim), convert to pdf, reduce size of images. Useful to run for example on the /Figures folder of a LaTex project.
